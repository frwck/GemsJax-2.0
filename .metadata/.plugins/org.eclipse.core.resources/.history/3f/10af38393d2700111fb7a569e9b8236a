/**
 * Is the abstract API interface, that provides communication with the underlying network object like a socket.
 * With this additional class over the plain network communication object, the programmer gets the ability to
 * change the type of the underlying communication object at any time (for example, from WebSocket to Comet), without have to
 * change any other part in the application layer above.<br />
 * <b>Important is to understand the conecpt of sending and receiving data:</b>
 * <ul>
 * <li> <u>To send data:</u> Don't send data direct via {@link #send(String)}.<b>Use a {@link OutputChannel} and {@link Message}s</b>
 * A {@link Message} wraps the communication protocol into a object and via {@link OutputChannel#send(Message)} a {@link Message} can 
 * be send. Internally the {@link OutputChannel} will transform a {@link Message} object in a String (specified in the protocol) by calling {@link Message#toXml()}
 * and than send this generated String by calling {@link CommunicationConnection#send(String)}
 * </li>
 * 
 * <li>
 * <u>To receive data:</u> Data can only be received by registering a {@link InputChannel}. <b>Note that "data" means</b> in this case a <b>string representation of a {@link Message} specified by the communication protocol</b>
 * The incomming data-sting is forwarded to every registered {@link InputChannel}, which matches the {@link InputChannel#getFilterRegEx()}.
 * Then the {@link InputChannel} is responsible to parse the incoming data-string {@link InputChannel#onMessageReceived(String)} into a {@link Message} object.
 * </li>
 * </ul>
